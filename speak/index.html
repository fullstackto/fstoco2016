      <h2>Our Style</h2>
      <p>Speakers at Full Stack Toronto events are subject matter experts with extensive industry experience. Attendees will walk away having not only learned the why of what they're doing, but also how to execute on ideas.</p>

      <p>Workshop-style sessions with a focus on all layers of web development—in a commercial free environment—is what really sets Full Stack Toronto events apart from all other development events.</p>

      <p>If you think you’ve got what it takes to deliver an exceptional talk in front of 100 intermediate and senior web developers we would like to hear from you! We have identified a few key topics that we will be looking to cover at this years conference but are open to all topics of an intermediate to advanced level, introductory talks are welcome if they are about an intermediate or advanced development topic or practice.</p>
