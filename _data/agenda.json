      "description": "More and more, we think about responsive design beyond just RWD. The future of interactions is being redefined each day with new devices, emerging ecosystems and unplanned user flows.\n\nCould responsive design be perceived as intelligent? Should our daily tools act (and feel) smarter? Is it too much to ask for designers and developers to go that extra mile, and minimize the friction that is often created by poor interactions, integrations and experiences.\n\nNow that we are designing with screen sizes and aspect ratios in mind, we should go a step further and plan strategically to utilize the device data that’s already collected and available. Tin's talk provides case studies of where intelligent design with fewer features has had a great impact.\n\nIn this session you'll expand your definition of responsive beyond RWD, rethink how you design and develop responsive software, see examples of how intelligent design can improve industry-leading applications, see how you can include Smart First approach into your UX and UI processes.",

The session will go through how to create data object model relations, design for performance in difficult areas with no signal, and how to develop a local NoSQL datebase that syncs to the cloud.\n\nWe will go over code on how to have your mobile application function offline without relying on the network. You will gain knowledge in NoSQL databases technologies and walk away with insights on how to create offline type of applications that to sync to the cloud.\n\nCouchbase Mobile is a thin client library that would help developers with their mobile projects in creating a local data layer for offline user experience and will provide fast sync capabilities when there is available network connectivity.",

If you’re a passionate developer that’s excited about the technology you work with every day, you probably spend a fair bit of time outside of the office doing something that looks a lot like what you do at work. Even if you’re excited about your work, it’s important to find ways to rest, recharge and disconnect periodically.

      "description": "Modularity reduces software complexity. OSGi is the best model to modularize Java. It works at development as well as runtime and scales from embedded devices to large, distributed clusters. Web applications implementing modularity at runtime provide interesting capabilities to adapt quickly to customer needs and dynamic environments.\n\nBut there is no out-of-the-box infrastructure. Few containers provide OSGi support, which is not always complete. Very often, developers start with an OSGi framework by themselves and add technology individually, which results into additional maintenance effort going forward.\n\nThe open source Eclipse Gyrex Project addresses this problem by providing an infrastructure for building OSGi clusters. It combines successful Eclipse RT technologies such as the Equinox OSGi framework, p2 and Jetty with standards such as JAX-RS, dependency injection and web sockets allowing seamless and pain-free creation and operation of clustered OSGi applications.\n\nIn this session we’ll present a technology stack based on Eclipse Gyrex that can be used for building scalable and modular web applications. We’ll start with an overview and continue with a deep dive through the stack using a sample application. You will also learn about typical cluster deployments for web applications and batch processing, understanding the development workflow and best practices.\n\nWe’ll also show you how HTML5 and JavaScript based frontends can be developed and deployment alongside the backend supporting its modularity.",

It’s usually in a quick and efficient manner to achieve a desired result; a need to know what’s going on in the world right now. The Guardian newspaper ‘Next Gen’ web team wanted to ensure this overview of news was achieved when moving to our new responsive website.\n\nAs a team we needed to recognise that we were way too embedded in the design to think about the context of the reader. By thinking from the perspective of the reader we were able to create a concept around the product technique ‘jobs to be done’ and suggest a responsive homepage that focussed on the time a reader had to spend and not the design of the page itself.\n\nThis talk will focus on how a small, dedicated product team created this solution, leading to the launch of a radically different Guardian news homepage and website in 2015.\n\nTakeaways\n- Understand the problem properly, don’t just throw resource at it\n- Admit when you’re wrong\n- Create a culture of small thinking teams\n- A big problem needs a big step back to gain perspective and solve",

It’s given us several expected benefits: self-documentation, loose coupling, and discoverability.\n\nAt the same time, it also uncovered some limitations of hypermedia. Hypermedia is designed so that the API works similarly to a traditional web site—load a resource, follow a link, and then load the next resource. Modern, native mobile apps, on the other hand, try very hard to NOT present a page-oriented, wait and load experience. Users expect their apps to be responsive, fast, and not beholden to a page-like paradigm.\n\nIn this presentation, Ben will discuss the design of our hypermedia API and demonstrate some of the strategies we’ve come up in the API and on the mobile client to address these concerns.\n\nWe’ll use different examples from our API to illustrate how we promoted parallel requests, improved cacheability, and minimized response sizes, all while staying true to the link- and form-driven spirit of hypermedia.",

      "description": "While Scrum, Agile and other methodologies may have made more sense in the early ‘90s, much has changed in the years since. Startups and businesses with workforces spread over many countries and time zones can no longer co-locate their employees as they were once expected to be able to. As our world continues to evolve, our businesses too are finding themselves in a position where they need to evolve too. To that effect, perhaps our software development methods should be reconsidered and rebuilt for this new world.\n\nOpen source in 2015 is ubiquitous. Potentially every person in the free world benefiting from modern technology is also benefiting from open source in some fashion. When you consider the potential sea of diversity developing for the world’s most popular open source projects, you can’t help but wonder how they’ve been able to succeed without the benefit of managers, meetings, and code sprints.\n\nUpon researching how these types of projects have succeeded, I’ve been able to determine that these projects share a set of principles which could be considered the tenets of the Open Development Method.",

That's how WebAR was born, an open source project which does Augmented Reality using web standards. We were wondering how far we could push the technology...the good news is that we can go pretty far! \n\nFirst, we succeeded on making AR run in a browser. We were already quite happy with this, but then we went for the moon and wanted to run that on mobile phones too. And it turns out it actually works! Imagine that: Being able to provide free AR for everybody to use in their everyday life with their mobile devices!  \n\nWebAR shows us how to get Augmented Reality using only web technologies. It is an open source threex extension for three.js. It captures the video with webrtc, localizes the AR markers using artoolkit,\nand displays the 3d on top of your reality with three.js.\n\nI will tell you everything you need to know to write your own Augmented Reality application!

This probably left a bitter taste in your mouth, especially when things went wrong.\n\nThose in the industry have been working hard to sweeten the deal again - efforts have been made to bring WebRTC into the mainstream and as a result the technology is experiencing a rebirth. Thanks to those who have remained dedicated to improving the situation for those around them, WebRTC is finally starting to fulfil the original expectations that were had of it. Both the technology and the support networks have been built up to make experimenting with it again a pleasure, not a pain.\n\nWebRTC has grown up; in this talk you will learn how far along the tech has come, its current capabilities, the amazing things that people are starting to do with it, and how simple getting started with the new toolsets available.",

Currently, it supports DSLs for entities/classes, parsers, animations, database queries, interactive documents, and, most importantly, new DSLs.\n\nFOAM supports building text, HTML, and graphical views for DSLs using a small Model View Controller (MVC) library, which is itself modeled with FOAM. This library can also be used by modeled Javascript applications.\n\nFOAM increases developer productivity by allowing them to express solutions at a higher, more succinct level. The MVC library also increases application performance through its efficient data-binding, caching, and query-optimization mechanisms.",

When additions can impact every aspect of your project, and each day without a launched product costs the client (and your team) users, time, and money, initial detailed planning becomes immensely important.\n\nWe'll discuss the technology our team uses, the challenges we didn't expect, the things we didn't think of, the things that worked, and the things that didn't.",

      "description": "Anyone coding a Node prototype in their spare time knows that it's a pain to add a Web interface on top.\n\nFirst you have to code up the actual app (jQuery or Angular or React or other frameworks), then you have to import Bootstrap or hand-code CSS, then serve it all up, then connect it to the actual prototype server using some sort of an ad-hoc REST interface. All that for a quick-and-simple in-browser screen with a few buttons and some text.\n\nEven using Yeoman or prebuilt seed projects is annoying - because the core frontend frameworks are geared towards production and stability, not fast iteration of prototyping work. And dropping down to basic jQuery loses a lot of the productivity gains of richer toolsets.\n\nBARC (a tongue-in-cheek term!) is a set of simple NPM modules that streamline all that drudgery. Skip boilerplate CSS cruft with Boxbits, use Atomic Routes for easy back-button support, and Remote Control to bypass fiddling with Express POST routes and just call your server JS functions from the browser. UI rendering is driven by vdom-live - a tiny module that leverages virtual DOM to rapidly set up reactive frontend code.\n\nThis is a radical departure from the typical legacy Web stack, but it is geared towards maximum prototyping speed without worrying about stylesheets, AJAX or manually updating view widgets. Don't try this in production (yet)!",

These books have served as web optimization canon for a generation of web developers.\n\nThe problem is: it’s now 2015. Browsers, browser features, internet connectivity – they’ve all changed dramatically. A lot of the best practices from 2007 and 2009 no longer apply. And yet, many developers are still holding on to those practices – advocating for performance tweaks that are no longer relevant.\n\nIn this talk, I want to revisit many of these best practices. Some of them will focus on networking (e.g. # of HTTP requests), some on pure JavaScript, and some even on CSS. Basically: the whole web platform.\n\nI’ll use a mix of real world applications, developer tool walkthroughs, JSPerf benchmarks, etc. to demonstrate my points.",

      "topic": "Test Driven Infrastructure",
      "description": "Test Driven Development is a popular concept in Software Development, leading to higher quality code that's easier to maintain. Automated testing is normally a foreign concept in the Operations world, but as you ssh into your servers to make that quick fix or run your updated script (fingers crossed), you might be wondering if there's a better way. A way that gives you the confidence in your script and lets you test those scripts in isolation. Well I have good news for you, there is a better way! Test Driven Infrastructure (TDI) is now possible. I know, it sounds crazy.\n\nAt this session you'll learn the how, and more importantly the why, of TDI. You'll see how Chef (or any other Config Management framework) can be tested with Test Kitchen and ServerSpec. You'll also learn how to improve your feedback cycle with Docker, and using the Docker approach on a CI server. There may even be some live demos!\n\nFinally, the Ops world collides with the Dev world in true DevOps testing bliss.",

The best approach to take is to make sure the front-end team can work independently from the back-end team as needed, allowing them to develop and validate in as frictionless a manner as possible. Yuri Takhteyev (the CTO at Rangle.io) will discuss and demonstrate how to move ahead using HackStack.js, a new open source library for solving these challenges.",

      "description": "\"The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its chaos as effectively as possible” - Edsger Dijkstra. Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of an application. Languages such as Scala, Swift, and Haskell are great examples of functional languages. Multi-dimensional languages such as JavaScript have the capabilities to solve complex problems with the power of abstraction. Functional JavaScript provides you with the tools to better organize, debug, and test your code. It allows these things by constructing operations into reusable and composable building blocks. We will show you tips on how to reduce complexity in your application by employing functional practices such as monads, currying, high-order functions, map, reduce, and filter.",
