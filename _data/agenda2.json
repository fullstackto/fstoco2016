If you’re a passionate developer that’s excited about the technology you work with every day, you probably spend a fair bit of time outside of the office doing something that looks a lot like what you do at work. Even if you’re excited about your work, it’s important to find ways to rest, recharge and disconnect periodically. After spending 7 years building a team of passionate developers, I’ve learned that everyone approaches work-life balance differently, with vastly different results.",

The future of interactions is being redefined each day with new devices, emerging ecosystems and unplanned user flows.\n\nCould responsive design be perceived as intelligent? Should our daily tools act (and feel) smarter? Is it too much to ask for designers and developers to go that extra mile, and minimize the friction that is often created by poor interactions, integrations and experiences.\n\nNow that we are designing with screen sizes and aspect ratios in mind, we should go a step further and plan strategically to utilize the device data that’s already collected and available. Tin's talk provides case studies of where intelligent design with fewer features has had a great impact.\n\nIn this session you'll expand your definition of responsive beyond RWD, rethink how you design and develop responsive software, see examples of how intelligent design can improve industry-leading applications, see how you can include Smart First approach into your UX and UI processes.",

        "description": "Modularity reduces software complexity. OSGi is the best model to modularize Java. It works at development as well as runtime and scales from embedded devices to large, distributed clusters. Web applications implementing modularity at runtime provide interesting capabilities to adapt quickly to customer needs and dynamic environments.\n\nBut there is no out-of-the-box infrastructure. Few containers provide OSGi support, which is not always complete. Very often, developers start with an OSGi framework by themselves and add technology individually, which results into additional maintenance effort going forward.\n\nThe open source Eclipse Gyrex Project addresses this problem by providing an infrastructure for building OSGi clusters. It combines successful Eclipse RT technologies such as the Equinox OSGi framework, p2 and Jetty with standards such as JAX-RS, dependency injection and web sockets allowing seamless and pain-free creation and operation of clustered OSGi applications.\n\nIn this session we’ll present a technology stack based on Eclipse Gyrex that can be used for building scalable and modular web applications. We’ll start with an overview and continue with a deep dive through the stack using a sample application. You will also learn about typical cluster deployments for web applications and batch processing, understanding the development workflow and best practices.\n\nWe’ll also show you how HTML5 and JavaScript based frontends can be developed and deployment alongside the backend supporting its modularity.",

It’s usually in a quick and efficient manner to achieve a desired result; a need to know what’s going on in the world right now. The Guardian newspaper ‘Next Gen’ web team wanted to ensure this overview of news was achieved when moving to our new responsive website.\n\nAs a team we needed to recognise that we were way too embedded in the design to think about the context of the reader. By thinking from the perspective of the reader we were able to create a concept around the product technique ‘jobs to be done’ and suggest a responsive homepage that focussed on the time a reader had to spend and not the design of the page itself.\n\nThis talk will focus on how a small, dedicated product team created this solution, leading to the launch of a radically different Guardian news homepage and website in 2015.\n\nTakeaways\n- Understand the problem properly, don’t just throw resource at it\n- Admit when you’re wrong\n- Create a culture of small thinking teams\n- A big problem needs a big step back to gain perspective and solve",

        "description": "At Comcast, the backbone of our cross-platform X1 Entertainment Operating System is a hypermedia API supporting both XHTML and HAL as media types. It’s given us several expected benefits: self-documentation, loose coupling, and discoverability.\n\nAt the same time, it also uncovered some limitations of hypermedia. Hypermedia is designed so that the API works similarly to a traditional web site—load a resource, follow a link, and then load the next resource. Modern, native mobile apps, on the other hand, try very hard to NOT present a page-oriented, wait and load experience. Users expect their apps to be responsive, fast, and not beholden to a page-like paradigm.\n\nIn this presentation, Ben will discuss the design of our hypermedia API and demonstrate some of the strategies we’ve come up in the API and on the mobile client to address these concerns.\n\nWe’ll use different examples from our API to illustrate how we promoted parallel requests, improved cacheability, and minimized response sizes, all while staying true to the link- and form-driven spirit of hypermedia.",

        "description": "It can be a struggle to translate the details of a design vision into the browser. Creating bitmap images, icons, and graphics can be time consuming and result in inconsistency and difficulty with managing updates. Scalable vector graphics (SVGs) might be just what you're looking for.\n\nSVGs are now supported on every modern browser and mobile device, and usage is on the upswing, but most people only use them for icons. Most developers and designers don’t realize how powerful and useful SVGs are. From scalable images to full-blown web applications, SVGs fit many needs.\n\nIn this session:\n- I will discuss the importance of understanding the capabilities of SVGs and how developers and designers can improve the quality of designs created in the browser. \n- Through an understanding of SVG capabilities you will know how each layer of Illustrator is rendered through SVGs in the browser. \n- You won’t learn about SVG font icons; you WILL learn about how to efficiently export SVGs so your team won’t curse your name. With SVGs you can render each design layer directly in the browser. \n- Apply filters, lighting effects, gaussian blur, and animations, all directly through the use of this file format. Get exactly what you want in the browser.\n- Plus a few of my favorite tips/tricks about SVG elements and attributes.",

This probably left a bitter taste in your mouth, especially when things went wrong.\n\nThose in the industry have been working hard to sweeten the deal again - efforts have been made to bring WebRTC into the mainstream and as a result the technology is experiencing a rebirth. Thanks to those who have remained dedicated to improving the situation for those around them, WebRTC is finally starting to fulfil the original expectations that were had of it. Both the technology and the support networks have been built up to make experimenting with it again a pleasure, not a pain.\n\nWebRTC has grown up; in this talk you will learn how far along the tech has come, its current capabilities, the amazing things that people are starting to do with it, and how simple getting started with the new toolsets available.",

With FOAM, you can create Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), which are high-level models that can be interpreted or compiled to different languages or environments. Currently, it supports DSLs for entities/classes, parsers, animations, database queries, interactive documents, and, most importantly, new DSLs.\n\nFOAM supports building text, HTML, and graphical views for DSLs using a small Model View Controller (MVC) library, which is itself modeled with FOAM. This library can also be used by modeled Javascript applications.\n\nFOAM increases developer productivity by allowing them to express solutions at a higher, more succinct level. The MVC library also increases application performance through its efficient data-binding, caching, and query-optimization mechanisms.",

        "description": "As developers we face different challenges in building products for clients as compared to traditional websites. Use cases typically expand from the single to double or triple digits, code has to be scalable to account for potentially colossal growth in both user base and requirements, and feature creep becomes further reaching.\n\nUser feedback becomes an even more crucial component of the development process and leniency in code quality can mean the difference between finalizing a new feature in three days and seven. When additions can impact every aspect of your project, and each day without a launched product costs the client (and your team) users, time, and money, initial detailed planning becomes immensely important.\n\nWe'll discuss the technology our team uses, the challenges we didn't expect, the things we didn't think of, the things that worked, and the things that didn't.",

        "description": "High Performance Websites, by Steve Souders, was first released in 2007. The follow-up – Even Faster Web Sites – was published in 2009. These books have served as web optimization canon for a generation of web developers.\n\nThe problem is: it’s now 2015. Browsers, browser features, internet connectivity – they’ve all changed dramatically. A lot of the best practices from 2007 and 2009 no longer apply. And yet, many developers are still holding on to those practices – advocating for performance tweaks that are no longer relevant.\n\nIn this talk, I want to revisit many of these best practices. Some of them will focus on networking (e.g. # of HTTP requests), some on pure JavaScript, and some even on CSS. Basically: the whole web platform.\n\nI’ll use a mix of real world applications, developer tool walkthroughs, JSPerf benchmarks, etc. to demonstrate my points.",

Don’t you want APIs that handle their own dependencies and update themselves? Relax, we’ve got you covered. In this whirlwind tour of developing for Azure API Apps, we’ll go from zero to a full blown API and client code in minutes rather than days. API Apps expose Swagger metadata that it can be used to generate SDKs with a few cli commands. To boot, the Azure portal provides API management, definition, and hassle-free updates, along with built-in authentication functionality atop popular authentication providers like Twitter and Facebook. Come learn about the next wave of Azure technology available in the Azure App Service that will make it easier than ever for you and your customers to build REST APIs and complex workflow integrating across hundreds of solutions.",

A way that gives you the confidence in your script and lets you test those scripts in isolation. Well I have good news for you, there is a better way! Test Driven Infrastructure (TDI) is now possible. I know, it sounds crazy.\n\nAt this session you'll learn the how, and more importantly the why, of TDI. You'll see how Chef (or any other Config Management framework) can be tested with Test Kitchen and ServerSpec. You'll also learn how to improve your feedback cycle with Docker, and using the Docker approach on a CI server. There may even be some live demos!\n\nFinally, the Ops world collides with the Dev world in true DevOps testing bliss.",

The best approach to take is to make sure the front-end team can work independently from the back-end team as needed, allowing them to develop and validate in as frictionless a manner as possible. Yuri Takhteyev (the CTO at Rangle.io) will discuss and demonstrate how to move ahead using HackStack.js, a new open source library for solving these challenges.",
