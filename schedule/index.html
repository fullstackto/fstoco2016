        <p>Part of what makes #fstoco so great is our focus on high-quality content. Our schedule is designed to have something for the entire web team, as well as immerse yourself in other layers of the web, "The Full Stack". If you focus on front-end you will also be exposed to back-end, project or even ux throughout the day, there is something for everyone! The schedule is subject to change without notice, in case of a discrepancy between the website and the app, the app is the most correct and up to date. Enjoy the great content we have for you!</p>
