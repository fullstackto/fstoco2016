        <h2>About Full Stack Toronto</h2>
        <p>Full Stack Toronto is a non-profit organization that provides web developers with access to education and resources that cover intermediate to advanced web development, free of commercial content.</p>

        <p>Speakers at Full Stack Toronto events are subject matter experts with extensive industry experience. Attendees will walk away having not only learned the why of what they're doing, but also how to execute on ideas.</p>

        <p>Workshop-style sessions with a focus on all layers of web development—in a commercial free environment—is what really sets Full Stack Toronto events apart from all other development events.</p>

        <h2>Our Conference #fstoconf15</h2>
        <p>Full Stack Toronto Conference hosts speakers from around the world and across the stack! We organize things a bit differently too, all of our sessions are workshop-style where you can expect to leave with actionable items to continue your career growth, we keep the sessions free of commercial content so you don’t feel like you have been pitched to, and we leave ample time for you to network with your peers to learn about how they approach similar problems.</p>

        <p>This year we are excited to bring you the same commitment to awesome content and opportunities paired with improvements from your valued feedback.</p>
