        <h2>About Our Efforts</h2>
        <p>Full Stack Toronto is a non-profit organization that provides web developers with access to education and resources that cover intermediate to advanced web development, free of commercial content. We started out as a small meetup held monthly, consiting of 25 developers and grew to a full two day conference in November 2014. The first Full Stack Toronto Conference was attended by 200 developers and 36 speakers from around the world and was the first conference of it's kind to focusing on all layers of web development in Canada.</p>

        <p>Speakers at Full Stack Toronto events are subject matter experts with extensive industry experience. Attendees will walk away having not only learned the why of what they're doing, but also how to execute on the ideas.</p>

        <p>Workshop-style sessions with a focus on all layers of web development—in a commercial free environment—is what really sets Full Stack Toronto events apart from all other development events.</p>

        <p>This year Full Stack Toronto is excited to grow even further with our meetups reaching 50-100 attendees each month and an expected attendance of 400 at this years #fstoconf15.</p>

        <p>We need your help to continue our growth, through in-kind and paid sponsorships. All of our sponsorship levels are fully customizeable and we look forward to hearing from you at <strong>sponsorship@fsto.co</strong> for further details</p>
